<p id="sappc"><strong>Seneca Academic Policy For Promotion Committee</strong> </p>
<p> At the end of each semester, and at other intervals as may be appropriate, the cumulative record of each student is reviewed by a Promotion Committee. The Committee officially represents the teaching faculty involved with the student. The Promotion Committee recommends to the College: the grades which shall appear on the Student Academic Record (transcript); the granting of Supplemental Privilege, the granting of Advanced Standing; the withdrawal of students from the College for reasons of unacceptable performance including protraction by more than a year of the normal time required for completion of a program, attendance or behaviour; the awarding of Seneca College Certificates and Diplomas upon satisfactory completion of subject objectives; other Diplomas upon satisfactory completion of subject objectives; and other matters regarding the academic progress and performance of each student. When the recommendations of the Promotion Committee have been accepted by the College and posted to an official transcript, they are considered final, subject only to the Appeals Procedure. Under no circumstances will grades be conveyed to a student other than by means of the official transcript.</p>

<p> <strong id="pp12s">Promotion Procedure - 1st &amp; 2nd Semesters</strong></p>
<p> At&nbsp;<strong>first and second semester promotion meetings</strong>, the promotion committee looks at the student's academic performance for the semester as an indicator of probable future success in the program. The student's academic record may also be considered in the context of written documentation which the co-ordinator would have received from the student. This documentation clarifies the circumstances that might explain lapses in a student¡¯s academic performance. (For example, lengthy hospitalization during the semester).At this level, academic performance and extenuating circumstances therefore become the criteria that guide the promotion committee in the application of the following policies:</p>
<p> Any grade of DNC, DNA, or F entered on a student transcript is viewed as "<strong>NOT SUCCESSFUL</strong>" in a subject by the promotion committee.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> 1. A student may be told to repeat the subject(s) for which the student received the F, DNC, or DNA grade(s) in the previous semester. A second unsuccessful attempt in a professional subject may result in the student being withdrawn from the full-time&nbsp; program.</p>
<p> 2. A student may be withdrawn from the full-time program for up to two semesters&nbsp;<strong>if not successful</strong>&nbsp;in two professional subjects. Re-admission to the program depends upon successful completion of designated courses in an alternate setting with the minimum required grade of "B" to be attained.</p>
<p> 3. A student may be withdrawn from the full-time program&nbsp;<strong>if not successful</strong>&nbsp;in three or more semester subjects. Students are advised to consult with their co-ordinator or a guidance counselor to investigate alternate career paths.</p>
<p> 4. A student may be put 'on probation' for the next semester and/or recommended for a reduced course load due to a low grade point average (semester GPA &lt;1.8). A student on probation is not being withdrawn; the student is being given the opportunity to improve academic performance. A student who fails to improve their academic performance while 'on probation' may be asked to withdraw from the program.</p>
<p> 5. Student transcripts are reviewed each semester.&nbsp; Upon successful completion of a subject that was previously graded DNC, DNA or F, the unsuccessful grade is moved to a section of the transcript called "Not Applicable to the Current Program".</p>
<p> 6. The President's Honours List is a designation granted to those students who meet ALL of the following conditions in an academic semester:</p>
<ul>
<li>GPA of 4.0 (grades of A or better in all credit courses and SAT grades for all non-credit courses)</li>
<li>Enrollment in first semester English or above (if part of the program)</li>
<li>A curriculum course load for the designated semester (for example, students affiliated to Semester 1 of CPD must be registered in six subjects; students in Semesters 2 through 6 of CPA must be registered for five subjects)</li>
</ul>
<p> [<a href="#top">top</a>]<br /> &nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong id="pp36s">Promotion Procedure - 3rd Semester and Higher</strong></p>
<p> At promotion meetings for the&nbsp;<strong>third semester</strong>&nbsp;and above, the promotion committee evaluates a student¡¯s academic record in the context of both academic history and written documentation which the co-ordinator may have received from the student. This documentation clarifies the circumstances that might explain lapses in a student¡¯s academic performance. (For example, lengthy hospitalization during the semester).</p>
<p> At these levels, academic history and extenuating circumstances are considered by the the promotion committee in their application of the following policies:</p>
<p> 1. Any grade of DNC, DNA, or F entered on a student transcript is viewed as "<strong>NOT SUCCESSFUL</strong>" in a subject by the promotion committee.</p>
<p> 2. A student who is&nbsp;<strong>not successful</strong>&nbsp;in two or more professional subjects is evaluated on the basis of past academic history. The promotion committee may recommend one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>that the student be placed on academic probation for the next semester</li>
<li>that the student withdraw from the full-time program for up to two semesters,</li>
<li>that the student be withdrawn from the full-time program</li>
<li>that the student be withdrawn from the School of Information &amp; Communications Technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. A student may be told to repeat the subject(s) for which the student received the F, DNC, or DNA grade(s) in the previous semester. A second unsuccessful attempt in a professional subject may result in the student being withdrawn from the full-time program.</p>
<p> 4. A student who is&nbsp;<strong>not successful</strong>&nbsp;in two or more professional subjects after being readmitted to the full-time program or who is on academic probation may be withdrawn from the School of Information &amp; Communications Technology.</p>
<p> 5. Student transcripts are reviewed each semester.&nbsp; Upon successful completion of a subject that was previously graded DNC, DNA or F , the unsuccessful grade is moved to a section of the transcript called "Not Applicable to the Current Program".</p>
<p> 6. The President's Honours List is a designation granted to those students who meet ALL of the following conditions in an academic semester:</p>
<ul>
<li>GPA of 4.0 (grades of A or better in all credit courses and SAT grades for any non-credit courses)</li>
<li>Enrollment in first semester English or beyond (if applicable to the program)</li>
<li>A curriculum course load for the designated semester (for example, students affiliated to Semester 1 of CTY must be registered in six (6) subjects and students in Semesters 7 and 8 of BSD must be registered for five (5) subjects).</li>
</ul>
<p> [<a href="#top">top</a>]<br /> &nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong id="gp">Graduation Procedure</strong></p>
<p>* No student will be eligible to graduate with a Seneca College certificate or diploma if, in more than 30% of the subjects required for graduation, the student has received a"D" grade. For degree programs, no student will be eligble to graduate with an overall Grade Point Average (GPA) lower than "C+" (2.5 out of 4) or with an average in professional subjects lower than "C+" or with an average in non-professional subjects lower than "C" (2 out of 4).</p>
<p>* In accordance with Seneca's Academic Policy mandating full disclosure on student transcripts, the transcript will display&nbsp;<strong>ALL</strong>&nbsp;subjects in which the student was enrolled.</p>
<p>* Students who take a mixture of day and continuing education subjects are advised to successfully complete at least 70% of the total required subjects for graduation during the day in order to be signed off as a day student. Exceptions are evaluated on an individual basis. Please see your coordinator.</p>
<p>* Students who enter the program as direct entry students and are granted conditional advanced standings must successfully complete at least 50% of their subjects as a Seneca student.</p>
<p>* Some FCE (continuing education) subjects that cover the same subject material as a day subject may not be counted towards a student graduation. FCE subjects that do not use the same subject code as the day program should not be considered acceptable until confirmed by a coordinator during the semester you are enrolled in the subject.</p>
<p>* Students are expected to graduate with the program they started with. Any student that takes significantly longer than the six semesters used for an advanced diploma, four semesters for a diploma, eight semesters for a degree or two semesters for a certificate may be required to complete extra subjects that fulfill the current program requirements.</p>
<p>[<a href="#top">top</a>]</p>
<p> <strong id="tp">Transcript Procedure</strong></p>
<p> Students are responsible for reading and complying with directives appearing as comments on their academic transcript. A student who fails to comply with comment instructions may be asked to withdraw from the program. All comments are removed from the transcript at the time of graduation.</p>
<p> [<a href="#top">top</a>]</p>
<p> <strong id="tcns">Transfer to another Program</strong></p>
<p> When a particular program does not seem suitable for a student's skills and abilities, the student should consider transfering to another, more appropriate program. The sooner such transfers are done, the fewer credits that will be lost. Historically, for example, it is common for students to transfer between the CPD/CPA programs and the CNS/CTY programs after first semester, and since only one course is different between the two program streams, such transfer students lose only one credit. Similar transfers later on would result in more credit loss because the program streams diverge after first semester. Transfers from diploma to degree programs typically also result in some credit loss even if the content of the programs is similar, because the level of difficulty is typically higher in the degree programs. Students who feel that their current program is not suitable should consult with a program coordinator, to discuss the appropriateness, availability and transferability of other programs either within the School or elsewhere in the College.</p>
<p>[<a href="#top">top</a>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong id="ictas">ICT Advanced Standing (ADV) Policy</strong> Deadline for ADV Applications</p>
<p>Requests for ADV must be made prior to the start of the semester in which the subject for which a student is requesting ADV will be on the student’s timetable. For example: first semester students must apply for ADV in first semester subjects no later than the week before the semester starts. Students are advised not to leave requests for ADV until the last moment. Applications for any subject which a student has on their timetable will not be processed until after the second week of the semester if the request is not received prior to the start of the semester.</p>
<p><strong>Process for Transcripts from Canadian Institutions</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Requests for ADV must include a certified copy of a transcript from an accepted Canadian post-secondary institution. Transcripts from Canadian Universities and public Colleges are acceptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Transcripts from private Colleges and commercial certificates may be acceptable. Such transcripts may be accepted without credential evaluation, but will usually require credential evaluation, see below.</p>
<p><strong>Process for Transcripts from Foreign Institutions</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Requests for ADV based on education at a foreign post-secondary institution require credential evaluation, see below.</p>
<p><strong>Credential Evaluation</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>We accept credential evaluation from ICAS - <a href="http://www.icascanada.ca/home.aspx">http://www.icascanada.ca/home.aspx</a> or WES - <a href="http://www.wes.org/">http://www.wes.org/</a> or CES - <a href="http://learn.utoronto.ca/international-professionals/comparative-education-service-ces">http://learn.utoronto.ca/international-professionals/comparative-education-service-ces</a> <br /> Please keep in mind that it may take a month or more for credential evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>Subject Outlines</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Requests for ADV must be accompanied by detailed subject outlines in English. Such outlines must be authenticated by either an official stamp with signature from the issuing institution or provision of a URL which links to the subject outline at an institution’s web-site or certification by one of the accepted credential evaluation services, see above.</p>

<p><strong id="ictinc">ICT – SUP, DEF AND INC Policy</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Supplemental Examination</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>A grade of SUP is given when a student has completed and passed all requirements and evaluations for a course and failed the final exam. A grade of SUP is given at the discretion of the subject professor and the Promotion Committee. Generally speaking a Professor will consider the grade achieved on a final exam before granting the privilege of a supplemental exam. For example, if a student’s final exam grade is less than 50%, it is not likely that a supplemental exam will be granted. There is a fee charged to write a supplemental exam. Upon passing a supplemental exam the student will be awarded the minimum passing grade for that subject, in most cases a grade of D.</p>
<p><strong>Deferred Examination</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A deferred exam may be granted, upon request, when a student misses a final exam. A grade of DEF is given at the discretion of the subject professor and the Promotion Committee. There is no fee charged for a deferred examination and the final grade for the subject is calculated in the same manner as if the exam had been written when scheduled. A grade of DEF may be given for compassionate reasons. Compassionate reasons include, but are not limited to – death in the immediate family, unable to travel to the college because of flight cancellation and illness. Valid and verifiable documentation must be provided at the time a student requests a grade of DEF. See the section on Test and Exam Absence Policy.</p>
<p><strong>INC – Incomplete Grade</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A grade of INC may be granted when a student has not completed a required evaluation item of the course material. A grade of INC is given at the discretion of the subject professor and the Promotion Committee. INC may be granted if a student has failed to complete one assignment or required lab in a course and has satisfactorily completed all other required course evaluations. When a student sees a grade of INC on his transcript it is the responsibility of the student to know which assignment or lab was not completed and complete the required evaluation by the due date given on the student’s transcript. Failure to complete the outstanding work by the due date will result in a grade of F for the subject. If the missing evaluation is submitted by the due date the professor will mark it and change the student’s grade to whatever grade would normally be earned after calculating penalties for late submission of the required evaluation.</p>
